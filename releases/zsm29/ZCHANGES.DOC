Below is an extract from zsm.zsm giving the changes from version 2.8 + notes

In short, the bits in lower case in ZSM.zsm are mine!  Let's hope I haven't
added any new 'undocumented features'!


;-----------------------------------------------
;
;	Version 2.9 by R'ian  March 1988
;
;	a) message 'L' is a "Label error"		-- omission?
;	b) change modulus to '\',			-- personal taste,
;	  allowing '%' in labels			 same as zmac.com
;	c) give help if no command tail			-- being nice to user
;	d) check that boot code isn't too long		-- prevention better
;							 than crashing!
;	e) tell user where we're at			-- nice again
;	f) default origin 100h, not 0			-- personal taste,
;	  & made an equate				 same as zmac again!
;	g) add ASSERT					-- makes checks like
;							 'd' easier
;	h) default page length split into one		-- taste
;	  for CON: & one for LST:/file + equated
;	i) slight bug in drive select for .PRN		-- slight bug fix
;	  file fixed -- now O: works -- and tidy
;	  rest of setup code
;	j) allow multiple list options -- like		-- bug fix
;	  wot it said in the .DOC file
;	k) change source input routines a bit!		-- add a few equates
;							 mostly to prepare for
;							 version 3.0 (macros)
;	l) alter the list options symbol table		-- saves a few bytes
;	  to include their execution addresses,		 and t-states, but
;	  rather than index them up later...		 really taste again
;	m) add SORT/NOSORT				-- saves a lot of time
;							 for big programs & 
;							 easier than changing
;							 the sort algolrithm
;	n) add time/date to titles (if Z80 only		-- gosh, I'm nice to
;	  version running on a CP/M+ machine)		 users!
;	o) move 'start up' data to end of symbol	-- lack of space, good
;	  table & make more space at the start		 job I added 'd'!
;	p) add .LESS. -- signed less than		-- rest are unsigned
;	q) LIST ops don't do anything on pass 1.	-- cure a 'feature'
;	  Pass 2 now starts with the defaults
;	r) Stop too long labels overwriting such	-- bug fix
;	  uneeded variables as PC, Val & PassNo!
;	s) Fix -$, *$ etc bug in long DB & DWs		-- bug fix
;       t) Don't print date if before 11th Apr 88       -- in case date not set
;
;===============================================

Change 'm' (NOSORT) was added after seeing how long the sort was taking thanks
to change 'e'...  

Change 'o' was caused by an ASSERTion failing, which was helpful of it!

Changes 'q' & 'r' were made thanks to noticing the effects of tests in ZSMTEST
 -- I was testing the multiple list options & noticed that NONE of the .prn
     file was 'tabbed', instead of the bits after NOTAB
 -- + trying to generate a label error with a long label name, try it with
     version 2.8!

Change 's' was thanks to converting mvp.asm to .zsm...
