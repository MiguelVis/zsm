ZSM30.txt


I was really excited to see that someone had done some work on ZSM
and the new version is available on UK-Vol 65. I use this program
quite a lot and, over the years, have built up a 'hate list' of its
defects. These are mostly errors it tolerates, usually it does what
it thinks you mean, rather than hurting your feelings by pointing out
that you have made a mistake. Unfortunately it rarely gets it right,
and just leaves you to puzzle out where you went wrong.

I must say Ian Watters had done a good job with his revision, he had
even found bugs that were not on my quite extensive list. He had
also added several improvements and new facilities which have made
it a much better assembler. However, it was disappointing to find
that my worst 'hates' were still there waiting to catch the unwary.

It is for this reason that I decided, if I didn't get down to it and
put it right myself, no one else would. I have therefore spent
several months of part time work going through my 'hate list' and
fixing whatever I could. I won't claim I have found all the bugs,
Ian's work shows how a fresh mind will turn up things you never
thought of, but at least I have cleared my own list now. I offer the
results in this volume

I would be interested to hear anyone's views and further hates. However,
I am reluctant to embark on the major revision that would be involved in
including a 'Macro' facility. It would be better to do this with
ZMAC. Perhaps a broad hint could be given to its author.
