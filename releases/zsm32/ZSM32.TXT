Changes made in version 3.2
---------------------------

   - Solved bug in rotate op-codes (rl r, rlc r, rr r, rrc r, sla r,
     sra r, srl r): op-codes with 'c' register were translated to
     machine code as if the 'e' register was used instead. See S24
     section.
   - Added patch from Ed, to restore support for date/time in titles
     in CP/M 3: "This patched version restores date/time code as
     assembly-time option (see DATE EQU). Now works with 8080 or Z80.".
